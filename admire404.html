We are proud to offer all the sparkle plus the sustainability
                  of a more ethically sourced luxury stone. Our sources are
                  eco-friendly with no mining, deforestation, environmental
                  impacts, or unfair labour practices. Lab-grown diamonds are
                  identical to mined diamonds in every aspect, except their
                  origin. They're indistinguishable physically, chemically, and
                  visually. Like natural diamonds, lab-grown diamonds also have
                  their own unique characteristics, from clarity to colour.
                  However, all of our lab-grown diamonds share one thing in
                  common: exceptional beauty and quality. Our diamonds are
                  certified based on the 4C's - Carat, Clarity, Color, and Cut -
                  by gemological institutes such as the GIA. Lab-grown diamonds
                  are more affordable, both for the planet and for consumers,
                  costing up to 50% less than mined diamonds of the same grade.
                  Our diamonds are responsibly sourced, and we can trace them
                  back to the lab of origin, ensuring that no conflict diamonds
                  are used in our jewellery.
