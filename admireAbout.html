          <p class="sidePadding" style="color: #f0f0e8">
            Admire Diamonds was founded by Imren Akkir in 2021 who has since
            worked extremely hard to build a prestigious luxury brand. Equipped
            with vast knowledge in the industry of diamonds and semi-precious
            stones, Imren has a vision to create exceptional bespoke jewellery,
            with the motion of providing luxury at value pricing.
          </p>
          <p class="hide sidePadding" style="color: #f0f0e8">
            All of our pieces are made in London, completely bespoke, in the
            hands of artisans and ‘stamped’ with full hallmarking. We have
            exclusive access to the global loose diamond market, enabling us to
            offer you huge savings in comparison to any ‘high street’ or
            ‘mainstream’ jewellers. Our mission is to offer bespoke fine
            jewellery at the most reasonable prices, and we do this by being
            completely remote! (Apart from our workshop of course). Therefore,
            as there is no physical shop front, we are able to cut down any
            overheads that are typically associated with a jewellery retail shop
            and offer you beautifully crafted, luxury diamond jewellery, at
            unbeatable prices.

      <!-- Procedure  -->
      <h2>Procedure</h2>
      <p class="sidePadding">
        The process for creating your dream piece will occur in 4 simple steps.
        The process takes between 4 to 6 weeks in total from confirmation of
        order to completion. The completed dream piece will be delivered along
        with all necessary certifications and appraisals (you will need this for
        insurance purposes). We offer nationwide, fully insured shipping methods
        or, in some cases, hand delivery to you.

            We are proud to offer all the sparkle plus the sustainability of a
            more ethically sourced luxury stone. Our sources are eco-friendly
            with no mining, deforestation, or unfair labour practices. Lab-grown
            diamonds are identical to mined diamonds in every aspect, except
            their origin. They're indistinguishable physically, chemically, and
            visually. Like natural diamonds, lab-grown diamonds also have their
            own unique characteristics, from clarity to colour. However, all of
            our lab-grown diamonds share one thing in common: exceptional beauty
            and quality.
          </p>
          <p class="hide sidePadding" style="color: #f0f0e8">
            Our diamonds are certified based on the 4C's - Carat, Clarity,
            Color, and Cut - by gemological institutes such as the GIA.
            Lab-grown diamonds are more affordable, both for the planet and for
            consumers, costing up to 50% less than mined diamonds of the same
            grade. Our diamonds are responsibly sourced, and we can trace them
            back to the lab of origin, ensuring that no conflict diamonds are
            used in our jewellery.
