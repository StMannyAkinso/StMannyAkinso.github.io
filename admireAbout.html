            appraisals (you will need this for insurance purposes). We offer
            nationwide, fully insured shipping methods or, in some cases,
            hand delivery to you.

                We are proud to offer all the sparkle plus the sustainability of
                a more ethically sourced luxury stone. Our sources are
                eco-friendly with no mining, deforestation, or unfair labour
                practices. Lab-grown diamonds are identical to mined diamonds in
                every aspect, except their origin. They're indistinguishable
                physically, chemically, and visually. Like natural diamonds,
                lab-grown diamonds also have their own unique characteristics,
                from clarity to colour. However, all of our lab-grown diamonds
                share one thing in common: exceptional beauty and quality.
              </p>
              <p class="hide" style="color:#f0f0e8"> Our diamonds are certified based on the 4C's - Carat, Clarity,
                Color, and Cut - by gemological institutes such as the GIA.
                Lab-grown diamonds are more affordable, both for the planet and
                for consumers, costing up to 50% less than mined diamonds of the
                same grade. Our diamonds are responsibly sourced, and we can
                trace them back to the lab of origin, ensuring that no conflict
                diamonds are used in our jewellery.</p>
