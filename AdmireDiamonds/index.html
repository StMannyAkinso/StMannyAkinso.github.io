                  a very short notice proposal idea and required a engagement ring
                  to be made within 4 weeks. Without any hesitation I was
                  comforted that Imren was able to design and make me an
                  engagement ring to meet my short deadline. <br />
                  <br />
                  From the start to the end of the process Admire Diamonds helped
                  me with every aspect of the ring from size and colour to clarity
                  to cut, even sourcing me a GIA certified diamond. They gave me
                  the best recommendations for my budget. <br />
                  <br />
                  I was also always updated with diagrams and pictures of progress
                  made to keep me at ease that everything was going along as
                  planned. <br />
                  <br />
                  Once finished the ring was delivered in a beautiful light up
                  box, ready for the big day with all required certificates well
                  before the deadline. To top it all off, she said yes! <br />

                  working with Admire Diamonds for a very special occasion - the
                  birth of my son. I wanted to give my wife a special token of my
                  love and appreciation for all that she's done and continues to
                  do for our family, and Admire Diamonds helped me do just that.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  From start to finish, the team at Admire Diamonds was amazing to
                  work with. They were knowledgeable, patient, and truly listened
                  to what I was looking for in a diamond ring. The end result was
                  a stunning piece of jewelry that my wife absolutely loves. The
                  craftsmanship and attention to detail is evident in every aspect
                  of the ring, and I couldn't be happier with my choice to work
                  with Admire Diamonds. <br />
                  <br />
                  I highly recommend Admire Diamonds to anyone looking for a
                  unique and special piece of jewelry. Their commitment to
                  customer satisfaction and high-quality products is unmatched,
                  and I'm grateful to have had such a wonderful experience with
                  them. Thank you Admire Diamonds for helping make a special
                  moment even more unforgettable.

                  <i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> My experience with using Admire
                  Diamonds was amazing! From the moment we had our first
                  consultation with Imren till the day the rings were delivered
                  she was super! I was unsure what type of wedding band to go for
                  and she went out of her way to make sure we found the perfect
                  shape to suit my engagement ring. She was friendly and
                  professional throughout the whole process and I definitely using
                  Admire Diamonds as you will not be disappointed!

--------------

We are proud to offer all the sparkle plus the sustainability
                  of a more ethically sourced luxury stone. Our sources are
                  eco-friendly with no mining, deforestation, environmental
                  impacts, or unfair labour practices. Lab-grown diamonds are
                  identical to mined diamonds in every aspect, except their
                  origin. They're indistinguishable physically, chemically, and
                  visually. Like natural diamonds, lab-grown diamonds also have
                  their own unique characteristics, from clarity to colour.
                  However, all of our lab-grown diamonds share one thing in
                  common: exceptional beauty and quality. Our diamonds are
                  certified based on the 4C's - Carat, Clarity, Color, and Cut -
                  by gemological institutes such as the GIA. Lab-grown diamonds
                  are more affordable, both for the planet and for consumers,
                  costing up to 50% less than mined diamonds of the same grade.
                  Our diamonds are responsibly sourced, and we can trace them
                  back to the lab of origin, ensuring that no conflict diamonds
                  are used in our jewellery.
