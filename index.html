          <h2>Ensured Quality</h2>
          <p>
            All of our pieces are made in London, completely bespoke, in the
            hands of artisans and ‘stamped’ with full hallmarking. We have
            exclusive access to the global loose diamond market, enabling us to
            offer you huge savings in comparison to any ‘high street’ or
            ‘mainstream’ jewellers. Our mission is to offer bespoke fine
            jewellery at the most reasonable prices, and we do this by being
            completely remote! (Apart from our workshop of course). Therefore,
            as there is no physical shop front, we are able to cut down any
            overheads that are typically associated with a jewellery retail shop
            and offer you beautifully crafted, luxury diamond jewellery, at
            unbeatable prices.

            The process takes between 4 to 6 weeks in total from confirmation of
            order to completion. The completed dream piece will be delivery
            along with all necessary certifications and appraisals (you will
            need this for insurance purposes). We offer nationwide, fully
            insured shipping methods or, in some cases, hand delivery to you.

              very short notice proposal idea and required a engagement ring to
              be made within 4 weeks. Without any hesitation I was comforted
              that Imren was able to design and make me an engagement ring to
              meet my short deadline. <br />
              <br />
              From the start to the end of the process Admire Diamonds helped me
              with every aspect of the ring from size and colour to clarity to
              cut, even sourcing me a GIA certified diamond. They gave me the
              best recommendations for my budget. <br />
              <br />
              I was also always updated with diagrams and pictures of progress
              made to keep me at ease that everything was going along as
              planned. <br />
              <br />
              Once finished the ring was delivered in a beautiful light up box,
              ready for the big day with all required certificates well before
              the deadline. To top it all off, she said yes! <br />
              <br />
              Thank you Admire Diamonds for the beautiful ring and helping me
              out at such short notice.

              anything. The advice received was second to none, I had no choice
              but to go ahead with them and order mr ring and my partners rings.
              I bought an engagement ring along with wedding band and my wife
              brought my wedding ring from Admire Diamonds. The whole experience
              was amazing with no faults at all. We even made slight adjustments
              to our rings and they accommodated without any hesitation. We
              forgot to include engraving on our rings but before we collected,
              engraving was requested to Imren and as a good gesture Imren done
              this for us completely free of charge! If you are thinking about
              using Admire Diamonds please do not hesitate or look any further

              second to none. 100% buyer satisfaction.
