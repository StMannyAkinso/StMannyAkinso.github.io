            Our diamonds are certified based on the 4C's - Carat, Clarity,
            Color, and Cut - by gemological institutes such as the GIA.
            Lab-grown diamonds are more affordable, both for the planet and
            for consumers, costing up to 50% less than mined diamonds of the
            same grade. Our diamonds are responsibly sourced, and we can
            trace them back to the lab of origin, ensuring that no conflict
            diamonds are used in our jewellery.

                  to be made within 4 weeks. Without any hesitation I was
                  comforted that Imren was able to design and make me an

                  <br />
                  From the start to the end of the process Admire Diamonds helped
                  me with every aspect of the ring from size and colour to clarity
                  to cut, even sourcing me a GIA certified diamond. They gave me
                  the best recommendations for my budget. <br />
                  <br />
                  I was also always updated with diagrams and pictures of progress
                  made to keep me at ease that everything was going along as
                  planned. <br />
                  <br />
                  Once finished the ring was delivered in a beautiful light up
                  box, ready for the big day with all required certificates well
                  before the deadline. To top it all off, she said yes! <br />

                  Thank you Admire Diamonds for the beautiful ring and helping me

                  working with Admire Diamonds for a very special occasion - the
                  birth of my son. I wanted to give my wife a special token of my
                  love and appreciation for all that she's done and continues to
                  do for our family, and Admire Diamonds helped me do just that.

                  <br />
                  From start to finish, the team at Admire Diamonds was amazing to
                  work with. They were knowledgeable, patient, and truly listened
                  to what I was looking for in a diamond ring. The end result was
                  a stunning piece of jewelry that my wife absolutely loves. The
                  craftsmanship and attention to detail is evident in every aspect
                  of the ring, and I couldn't be happier with my choice to work
                  with Admire Diamonds. <br />

        The process takes between 4 to 6 weeks in total from
        confirmation of order to completion. The completed dream piece
        will be delivery along with all necessary certifications and
        appraisals (you will need this for insurance purposes). We offer
        nationwide, fully insured shipping methods or, in some cases,
        hand delivery to you.

          a very short notice proposal idea and required a engagement ring
          to be made within 4 weeks. Without any hesitation I was
          comforted that Imren was able to design and make me an
          engagement ring to meet my short deadline. <br />
          <br />
          From the start to the end of the process Admire Diamonds helped
          me with every aspect of the ring from size and colour to clarity
          to cut, even sourcing me a GIA certified diamond. They gave me
          the best recommendations for my budget. <br />
          <br />
          I was also always updated with diagrams and pictures of progress
          made to keep me at ease that everything was going along as
          planned. <br />
          <br />
          Once finished the ring was delivered in a beautiful light up
          box, ready for the big day with all required certificates well
          before the deadline. To top it all off, she said yes! <br />
