          short notice proposal idea and required a engagement ring to be made
          within 4 weeks. Without any hesitation I was comforted that Imren was
          able to design and make me an engagement ring to meet my short
          deadline. <br />
          <br />
          From the start to the end of the process Admire Diamonds helped me
          with every aspect of the ring from size and colour to clarity to cut,
          even sourcing me a GIA certified diamond. They gave me the best
          recommendations for my budget. <br />
          <br />
          I was also always updated with diagrams and pictures of progress made
          to keep me at ease that everything was going along as planned. <br />
          <br />
          Once finished the ring was delivered in a beautiful light up box,
          ready for the big day with all required certificates well before the
          deadline. To top it all off, she said yes! <br />
          <br />
          Thank you Admire Diamonds for the beautiful ring and helping me out at
          such short notice.

          working with Admire Diamonds for a very special occasion - the birth
          of my son. I wanted to give my wife a special token of my love and
          appreciation for all that she's done and continues to do for our
          family, and Admire Diamonds helped me do just that.
          <br />
          <br />
          From start to finish, the team at Admire Diamonds was amazing to work
          with. They were knowledgeable, patient, and truly listened to what I
          was looking for in a diamond ring. The end result was a stunning piece
          of jewelry that my wife absolutely loves. The craftsmanship and
          attention to detail is evident in every aspect of the ring, and I
          couldn't be happier with my choice to work with Admire Diamonds.
          <br />
          <br />
          I highly recommend Admire Diamonds to anyone looking for a unique and
          special piece of jewelry. Their commitment to customer satisfaction
          and high-quality products is unmatched, and I'm grateful to have had
          such a wonderful experience with them. Thank you Admire Diamonds for
          helping make a special moment even more unforgettable.

--------------

We are proud to offer all the sparkle plus the sustainability
                  of a more ethically sourced luxury stone. Our sources are
                  eco-friendly with no mining, deforestation, environmental
                  impacts, or unfair labour practices. Lab-grown diamonds are
                  identical to mined diamonds in every aspect, except their
                  origin. They're indistinguishable physically, chemically, and
                  visually. Like natural diamonds, lab-grown diamonds also have
                  their own unique characteristics, from clarity to colour.
                  However, all of our lab-grown diamonds share one thing in
                  common: exceptional beauty and quality. Our diamonds are
                  certified based on the 4C's - Carat, Clarity, Color, and Cut -
                  by gemological institutes such as the GIA. Lab-grown diamonds
                  are more affordable, both for the planet and for consumers,
                  costing up to 50% less than mined diamonds of the same grade.
                  Our diamonds are responsibly sourced, and we can trace them
                  back to the lab of origin, ensuring that no conflict diamonds
                  are used in our jewellery.
