      times in order to use our online retail services. <br />
      <br />
      <strong> PRIVACY POLICY AND DATA PROTECTION</strong> <br />
      Admire Diamonds gathers and uses your information in accordance with the
      UK General Data Protection Regulation (“UK GDPR”), the Data Protection Act
      2018 and any UK related implementing legislation (“applicable data
      protection legislation”). Admire Diamonds will process your data securely
      and transparently in accordance with our policies. This policy applies to
      our customers ordering from outside of the UK as well i.e. all
      international orders processed on our website and other platforms such as
      Instagram.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>USER CONDUCT OF WEBSITE</strong> <br />
      You agree to abide by all applicable local, state, national and
      international laws and regulations and are solely responsible for all acts
      or omissions that occur under your usage, including the content of your
      transmissions through our website. All information, designs, drawings, and
      other specifications on the website are the exclusive property of Admire
      Diamonds only. Any copying, transmission or re- transmission of the same
      requires the prior written approval of Admire Diamonds failing which the
      former is prohibited. <br />
      <br />
      <strong> ENTERING INTO A CONTRACT WITH US</strong> <br />A contract
      between you and Admire Diamonds will only exist for a sale of our items
      once you pay for and submit your order and until we receive notification
      of the same. We will notify you by email when we have dispatched your
      order. Acceptance of the order will be deemed both complete and to have
      been effectively communicated to you when Admire Diamonds sends the order
      acknowledgement email to you (whether or not you receive that email).
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>ITEM PRICES</strong> <br />
      All prices for Admire Diamonds’ items will be as stipulated at the time of
      you placing an order on our website. We are entitled to amend the price to
      account for an increase in our supplier’s prices, or the imposition of new
      taxes or duties, or if due to an error or omission, the price for one of
      our items is found to be incorrect. <br />
      <br />
      <strong>ITEM SPECIFICATIONS </strong><br />
      Some of the items may vary in colour/style. Therefore, whilst we will
      include as much details as possible for our item descriptions, it may not
      be reasonably possible to keep specifications completely up to date. All
      descriptive matters, pictures, colours, specifications, and advertising on
      the website are for the sole purpose of giving an approximate description
      of the items to the best of our ability and knowledge. <br />
      <br />
      <strong>DISPATCH AND DELIVERY PROCESS</strong><br />
      We aim to complete and jewellery items within 4-6 weeks of placing your
      order. While we send you an estimated delivery date/time upon processing
      your order, we cannot guarantee a specific arrival date, as it all depends
      on the item/s ordered and delivery timescales, including potential delays
      with Royal Mail or our couriers, which is outside of our control. Admire
      Diamonds is pleased to also accept international orders.  We offer free UK
      shipping and we offer international shipping, which is chargeable to the
      Customer. Both are fully insured “door to door”. You will also be able to
      track the shipping of your order online and will be provided with those
      details by us. On the date of delivery, you will need to sign for the
      delivery on receipt, after which time the item/s become your sole
      responsibility. We will not be responsible for any losses, costs, damages,
      or charges that you may suffer in the event we have had to delay the
      dispatching, delivering and/or supplying of our item/s where it was
      outside of our control and/or the responsibility of Royal Mail or our
      courier. This will not affect your insurance rights for the dispatched
      item/s. ‍ <br />
      <br />
      <strong>IF YOU ARE UNHAPPY </strong><br />
      We will be happy to carry out ring sizing on one occasion at no charge
      within one year of purchase. You will, however, be responsible for return
      postage fees. We charge for additional ring sizing and/or any ring
      alterations.  A bespoke ring can be returned and fully refunded within 14
      days less our bespoke work costs for work done. Please get in touch with
      us by email at info@admirediamonds.com  for more information and we can
      advise on what amount of the price we can refund to you after calculating
      the same. You will be responsible for the costs of returning the item to
      us, preferably by registered/special delivery, in case it gets lost or
      delayed in transit. We strongly advise that you obtain proof of posting
      and use recorded/special delivery using Royal Mail, DHL or FedEx. We will
      not be liable if the returned items are delayed and/or lost in transit. We
      will only be liable from the date of receipt of the returned order. <br />

      <br />
      Some countries outside of the UK may be subject to taxes and duties.
      Payments of tax and duties are the responsibility of the Customer or
      Recipient of our items. Admire Diamonds is, under no circumstances, liable
      for country specific custom taxes and/or duties as a result of delivering

      its own customs clearance levels. Although most countries accept all
      imports, some items may be refused entry to a specific country. Please
      make sure you check with your local customs office who can advise on the
      items that cannot enter their country. The Recipient/Customer may be
      liable for additional charges. It is the Customer’s sole responsibility to
      familiarise themselves with the laws and rules that apply to the country
      where the order will be delivered, before placing their order.  ‍<br />
